A **Simple**, **Minimalist** Template for Noir Projects.

## Getting Started

Click [`use this template`](https://github.com/whitenois3/nplate/generate) to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

## Development

**Setup**

You need both `nargo` and `foundry` installed.

Regarding the installation of `nargo`, please refer to its repo [here](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir).

**Building**

```bash
cd circuits
# generates the Solidity contract
nargo codegen-verifier
# generates a file "p.proof" in circuits/proofs
nargo prove p
```

**Testing**

Before testing, be sure you have generated the updated Solidity verifier contract as well as a valid proof!

```bash
forge test --ffi
```
